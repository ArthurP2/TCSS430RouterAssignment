This program emulates the router network.

The Network contains a list of all the routers. Each router has ports that connect to a specific IP
Address. Each router can also connect to another router and stores this information locally in the
Router class.

Each router has a router table, but only the first router will have its table shown. Each table holds
10 destination IP addresses. The router can calculate how many hops to other routers it would need to reach
its destination. This does that by doing a breadth-first-search on the network graph.

The user can disconnect a specific router from all other routers in the network. They do this by typing "kill.(router number)",
where the router number would be the number displayed on the router in the GUI. Typing in kill.3 would disconnect
router 3 from all other routers. Typing in connect.1.2 would connect router 1 and 2 together. Both commands update the table
and update the timestamp.
